* Free software: GNU General Public License v3

Features
--------

A very generic seed NPC generator with lots of user defined data.  It should be:

 #. Something that generates a (nearly) ready to use NPCs.
 #. Something that generates interesting NPCs.
 #. Something that generates intricate NPCs.
 #. Something that is reusable between systems and settings all supported
    by simple configurations.
 #. Something that will help others which would include Unix, Windows, and web
    interfaces as well as (possibly) an app and an API/library so it can be 
    used within other projects. 
 #. The code is in Python, the data is plain text.

Based on the above, this background is but one posibility:

*The beautiful Dr Letícia Madeira was a prestigious pathologist in the
Police force.  She left under strange circumstances and was for a time a
local MD at a free clinique and is now trying to help by getting (read:
smuggling) drugs to those in need.  Sadly, she is rubbish at it and has
not been caught by either the Law or gangs because of her past Police
contacts. However, this cannot last...*
